Project Overview
This repository contains my implementation of the classic Unity Roll-a-Ball tutorial. This project serves as a midterm assignment to demonstrate fundamental Unity skills, including physics, user input, camera movement, object collection, and version control using GitHub.

Unity Version: 6.312f1

Development Diary & Steps Completed
As per the assignment requirements, I successfully implemented the following core stages of the game:

Setting up the game: Created the base Unity project, set up the initial scene, and organized my file structure (Folders: Scripts, Scenes, Materials, Prefabs).
Moving the player: Added a Sphere to act as the player, attached a Rigidbody component for physics, and created a PlayerController script utilizing Unity's Input System to apply forces for movement.
Moving the camera: Wrote a CameraController script to calculate the offset between the camera and the player, allowing the camera to smoothly follow the ball without rotating with it.
Setting up the play area: Constructed the ground and surrounding walls to keep the player from falling off the edge. Applied custom materials to distinguish the ground from the walls.
Creating collectibles: Created cube objects, made them spin using a Rotator script, turned them into Prefabs, and scattered them across the play area. Implemented OnTriggerEnter in the player script to "collect" (deactivate) them upon collision.

What I Learned
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with several core game development concepts:

Physics & Rigidbodies: Understanding how to move objects using physics forces rather than directly changing their transform positions.
Input System: Capturing keyboard/controller inputs to control a game object.
Scripting Basics: Using variables, Update(), FixedUpdate(), and LateUpdate() appropriately in C#.
Triggers vs. Colliders: Learning the difference between hard collisions and trigger events (for the collectibles).
Version Control: Setting up a .gitignore file specifically for Unity to prevent uploading massive Library and temporary files to GitHub.
